# Sudoku-solver

Description:

Developed a Javascript-based Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The solver takes an input 9x9 Sudoku grid, where empty cells are represented by 0, and fills in the missing numbers while adhering to Sudoku rules.

Key Details:

1.Designed a backtracking algorithm to efficiently explore possible number placements and backtrack when necessary.

2.Developed functions to identify empty cells, check for valid number placements, and handle the solving process recursively.

3.Ensured the solver produced correct solutions for various difficulty levels of Sudoku puzzles.

Impact:

1.Strengthened logical thinking and algorithmic skills by designing an efficient solution for a real-world problem.

2.Demonstrated proficiency in Javascript programming and data structures through the implementation of the Sudoku solver.

3.Showcased the ability to work on individual projects and self-motivation to learn and solve complex problems.
